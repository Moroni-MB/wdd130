            My latest job has been to work as a phone specialist for the
            BYU-Idaho Support Center. Our misison is to simplify, and
            accelerate, the user experience. As a phone specialist I am in
            charge of being on stand-by to provide support for any student,
            parent, faculty, or community member that calls our school for any
            support. I also have access to a database which allows me to find,

            patience to provide support while also being empathetic to the
            issues the caller is having.
